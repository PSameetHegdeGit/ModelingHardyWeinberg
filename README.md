The Hardy Weinberg equations describe the genotypic distributions of a population. Given certain conditions, no matter how genotypes are distributed across a population in the initial group, genotypic distributions eventually standardizes. This equilibrium is known as the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. While the concept is fairly intuitive (as the standardization of genotypic ratios is more of a byproduct of basic probability than being a natural phenomenon), it can be though of as what happens in an idealized simulation. As such, we can use it to consider what happens to a population distribution when we drop certain conditions. As we drop conditions, we get closer to representing a real-life situation where simulations become less predictable.

We additionally created a frontend written in Unity that collected the genotypic distributions from this backend to show a visual depiction of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
